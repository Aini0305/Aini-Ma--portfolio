                Hold infinity in the palm of your hand. <a href="#" class="dead-link" >And eternity in an hour.</a>; 
                If you were a teardrop;In my eye,

For fear of losing you,I would never cry. <a href="#" class="dead-link" >And if the golden sun,</a>; Should cease to shine its light, <a href="#" class="dead-link" >not you</a>; 
Just one smile from you,Would make  <span id="ghost" >my whole world bright.</span>.
